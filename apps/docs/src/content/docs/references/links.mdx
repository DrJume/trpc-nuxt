The links exported by `trpc-nuxt/client` are convenience wrapper around the tRPC's [links](https://trpc.io/docs/client/links) that replaces regular `fetch` with [`$fetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/dollarfetch) from Nuxt and sets the default headers using [`useRequestHeaders`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-request-headers#userequestheaders).

```ts
// plugins/trpc.ts
import { createTRPCNuxtClient, httpLink } from 'trpc-nuxt/client'
import type { AppRouter } from '~/server/trpc/routers'

const client = createTRPCNuxtClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpLink({
      // Select headers to pass to `useRequestHeaders`.
      // By default, `useRequestHeaders()` returns all headers.
      pickHeaders: ['authorization']
    }),
  ],
})
```
